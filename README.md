  In order to keep up with the fast-changing AI world and grasp some basic info of this field, I've attended several lectures as well as reports given by some experts and students/researchers. This file acts as a notebook for me personally. This term, unfortunately, I lost some pages in my notebook. And I find it quite neccessary to update and keep trace of my notes. Meanwhile, I find it a great opportunity to share my notes here on Github.

  And I'd like to recommend some platforms where I get access to these kinds of lectures&sharing:

·智源社区

·人大高瓴人工智能学院

·AI TIME 论道

·南方科技大学

·北京大学人工智能研究院

·清华大学信息国家研究中心

·香港科技大学广州 | 信息枢纽

·中国中文信息学会青年工作委员会
